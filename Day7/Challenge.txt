Task

Given an array, A, of N integers, print A's elements in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.



Example

A = [1, 2, 3, 4]

Print 4 3 2 1. Each integer is separated by one space.



Input Format

The first line contains an integer, N (the size of our array).
The second line contains N space-separated integers that describe array A's elements.




Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000
1 <= A[i] <= 1000, where A[i] is the ith integer in the array.



Output Format

Print the elements of array A in reverse order as a single line of space-separated numbers.



Sample Input

4
1 4 3 2



Sample Output

2 3 4 1
